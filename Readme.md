This is a project of Smart garbage sorting truck.
The environment we had used is Raspberry pi 4B. As you can see, python is our programming language.
And you can run main.py in our car to see the effect.
What I want to tell you is that this library is the first version of it.
It has many error or tedious code, just because we had to finish it in a short time.
Thinking about the performance of Raspberry pi 4B is *** ** *****, my partners show me their opinions that using uart
as the external cell. So you can also find many uart running in machine.py.
